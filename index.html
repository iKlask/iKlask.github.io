I'm software engineer with an aspiration for video game development. Graduated Summa Cum Laude from DePaul University with
a B.S. in Computer Science and an emphesis in Game Systems. With 5 years of C family expeireince throughout school, I mainly
focus on C and C++ development through games and embedded system projects.

<p>
But thats the boring stuff, I'm an engineer with a love for games and a tinkerer at heart. What makes my brain tick is the intersection
of creativity and technical, which is one of the main reasons I love game development so much.

Besides that, you could describe my varying intrests in many way: I'm a Sci-fi nut, Beer nerd, 

geek, enthusiast, techie, fan, aficianado, adherant, zealot, fiend
