      For my senior year capstone project at DePaul University, my team and I created a mobile
      puzzle game titled Nik-0. Using Unity we built a puzzle game based around spreading power along
      a connected grid. But we wanted to include beautiful environments to make it more than just another puzzle game.

      As one of two programmers on the project, I worked closely with game designers and the sound technician to provide tools      for workflow and implementing game logic. 
      <p>Here are a few new things I explored on this project that I had never done before:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unity Editor Scripts for tools</li>
        <li>Third party audio integration (WWise)</li>
        <li>Unity Cinemachine</li>
        <li>Version control management via PlasticSCM</li>
      </ul>

      You can watch a trailer we put together <a href="https://youtu.be/mN_UKFrHims">here.</a>

      Ion Engine is a C++ game engine built during my junior year at DePaul
      University. The goal of the course was to learn about basic engine
      architecture through the creation of a game engine in C++. The only libraries we were given was
      a math library, a mesh loader, and an OpenGL renderer (which I replaced with a DirectX implementation).
      <p>The main engine features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tiered Collision system via Sphere, AABB, and OBB bounding volumes</li>
        <li>Resource Manager for assets</li>
        <li>GameObjects with alarms, collision, input, update, and draw callbacks</li>
        <li>Skybox and Terrain heightmap generation</li>
        <li>DirectX based renderer with basic shaders for Flat Color, Texture, Phong, Sprite, and WireFrame rendering</li>
      </ul>
