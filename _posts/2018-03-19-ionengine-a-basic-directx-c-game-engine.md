IonEngine is a C++ game engine built during my Junior year at DePaul University. The goal of the course was to learn about basic engine architecture through the creation of a game engine in C++.  As a bonus, I replaced the OpenGL graphics core that was given to us with my own DirectX implementation. 

The main engine features include:
* Teired Collision system via Sphere,  AABB, and OBB bounding volumes
* Resource Manager for assets
* GameObjects with alarms, collision, input, update, and draw callbacks
* Skybox and Terrain heightmap generation
* DirectX implementation with Flat Color, Texture, Sprite, WireFrame, and basic Phong Modeled shaders
